As you probably know, an operating system runs computer-based devices, including servers, laptops, smartphones, and many others, usually \"under the hood\".   \"Unix\" is the family of operating systems that runs the most devices.  If you have a Mac -- there's Unix under the hood.  An iPhone?  Unix under the hood. An Android phone? Guess what ... Unix under the hood.  And what are you running on now, in the cloud?  You guessed it. (But Windows machines?  Not Unix.)\n","\n","You can get under the hood of a Unix-based computer via the command line, often called the Terminal, and do all manner of crazy things.  We will study a few of them.\n","\n","We can access the command line of our cloud machines through the Jupyter/Colab Notebooks. You can use \"shell\" commands (such as the following) by prefixing the command with an exclamation point.\n","\n","**This is not required material for the course - but can be  useful to those who will do a lot of data manipulation, or who have some experience with UNIX/shell commands**\n","\n","*Here we will give you a brief overview, and show some very useful commands.  If you're serious about dealing with data, and you don't have much command-line experience, you can get the book [Data Science at the Command Line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) by Janssens. The first half of this (remarkably thin) book gives an excellent practical guide to dealing with data at the Unix command line.*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rt0DndMJS0_X"},"source":["#### Interaction with files and folders\n","\n","Colab crates a directory structure that you can navigate.  (You can see the directories by clicking the Folder icon on the left hand ribbon of the page).\n","\n"," We can also navigate the directory structure in which we are working using shell commands.  You will typically use commands such as `ls` (list directory contents) and `cd` (change to another directory). You can make a directory with `mkdir` or move (`mv`) and copy (`cp`) files. To delete a file you can `rm` (remove) it--careful, there's no getting it back.  To see the contents of a file you can `cat` it to the screen.\n","\n","Many commands have options you can set when running them. For example to get a listing of files as a vertical list with extra details you can call ls with the `-l` (list) flag, i.e., `ls -l`. During the normal course of using the command line, you will learn the most useful flags. If you want to see all possible options you can always read the `man` (manual) page for a command, e.g. `man ls`. When you are done reading the `man` page, you can exit by hitting `q` to quit.\n","\n","Use the \"%\" or \"!\" prefix to tell Colab you are using UNIX commands.

Searching through files can be done using _[regular expressions](http://www.robelle.com/smugbook/regexpr.html#expression)_ with a tool called `grep` (Global Regular Expression Printer).\n","\n","And do you remember that we can send the output of a command to the screen or into another command?  You can also direct output of a command (or a string of commands) into a file using the \"redirection\" operator `>`.  (NB: the pipe is also a redirection operator.  Another redirection operator is `>>`, which concatenates the output to the end of the file, rather than overwriting it.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":47,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"hq8-c7dtS1AN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706394247393,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":374,"user":{"displayName":"Christopher Volinsky","userId":"09256355646661007650"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["!grep '.*,-.*,-.*' users.csv > negative_users.csv"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZEEfn5N7S1AO"},"source":["(You'll have to look into the regular expression link to figure that one out.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"0oDrc8lwS1AO","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706394529816,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":293,"user":{"displayName":"Christopher Volinsky","userId":"09256355646661007650"}},"outputId":"faf42e29-84db-4154-df22-9b52864e8890"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["negative_users.csv  users.csv\n"]}],"source":["# should have created a new file...lets check\n","!ls"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!head negative_users.csv"],"metadata":{"id":"sqdPmYrw3ttC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706394535209,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":274,"user":{"displayName":"Christopher Volinsky","userId":"09256355646661007650"}},"outputId":"6281e9d5-2667-4114-d63f-204049c02225"},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dialgraft,-58.447222,-51.822777\n","quadratcranky,-14.393664,-7.969597\n","craytugofwar,-159.764233,-18.830922\n","poohvireo,-159.805556,-21.202739\n","unicyclistamiable,-175.149644,-21.241214\n","heomicron,-173.961717,-18.585336\n","driftmvc,-176.199228,-13.238281\n","moderatohorn,-172.008336,-13.829969\n","backedammeter,-170.7105,-14.331\n","smackswallow,-151.360614,-22.434069\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
