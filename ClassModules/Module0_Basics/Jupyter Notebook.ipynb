It is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. It is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\n","\n","- Language: The Jupyter Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python and R.\n","\n","- Sharing: Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.\n","\n","- Widgets (apps): Code can produce rich output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript. Interactive widgets can be used to manipulate and visualize data in realtime.\n","\n","\n","IPython notebooks are made up of **cells.**  There are two basics types of entries in an IPython notebook: **text cells** for comments, and **code cells** (commands). You can edit a cell by double clicking on it. You can get it back to the display mode (run a cell) by pressing the \"Play\" (▶) button, and you can also stop it with the \"square\" ◼︎ . Basically, all the tasks for cells can be found in the tool bar.  Try it now!  Doubleclick this cell, then click the play button above.

In a code cell, we can type any Python commands, running them by clicking \"Play\" in the toolbar. When we \"play\" a cell, the code in it is executed and it returns whatever is the result of running a code.  (Maybe an error!) Code cells will always start with \"`In [ ]:`\".\n","\n","We build our ipython notebooks with successive code cells, often interspersed with notes, images, and so on.  Because of this it is important to think of your notebook as a whole, and not just the individual cells.\n","\n","Importantly, some of the results of running a cell are \"remembered\" for subsequent cells, as long as the session continues running.  Usually the session keeps running as long as you don't stop your instance and you keep the notebook window open.  Sometimes when you get errors in running your cells, it's because something from a prior cell was forgotten for some reason.  If you look above under the dropdown menu Kernel above, you'll see that there are options for clearing your outputs, rerunning all the cells, etc.\n","\n","For example, in the following cell, it will remember that the **_VARIABLE_** called \"x\" is  the sum of two given numbers.

The program code is just text defining commands in certain programming language (e.g. Python). Often scripts cobble other commands into something useful that can be run again and again.\n","\n","As with other files on a computer, we identify the type of a script based on the extension of the file. Typically this extension identifies programming language that was used to develop the script, with each language having been assigned a conventional extension. For example, a file called \"script_example.py\" is a file with python commands, and a file called \"script_example.R\" is a file with the R language commands. Other extensions that might be encountered include: \".cpp\", \".scala\", \".php\", \".rb\", \".sh\".\n","\n","\n","This is how you save the file as file.py to be able to run the file later.\n","\n","![NewText](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pearl-yu/foster_2022fall/2022-master/Module0_Basics/images/saveaspy.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Why do we need scripts?
